# Welcome to GDSC's Hacktoberfest Scavenger Hunt!

This scavenger hunt consists of a series of riddles that lead from one GitHub repository to the next one. There are ten hidden repositories, and you'll be able to find the names of these repositories by solving the riddles!

## How to Play

1. Start at the `start_here.txt` file.
2. After solving, the answer you get is the name of the next repository. Search it up and solve the next riddle.
3. You must comment on the issue for each repository (except this one). _Not every riddle will require coding to solve. You may use online resources._
4. Once you reach the last and final repository, check in with an officer!

Happy hacking!
